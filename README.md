## By comparing the abundance of CrispR/shRNA in test conditions versus control conditions we can 
## assess which genes have a functional role related to the test condition. 
## i.e. If a set sgRNA guides targeting are enriched after drug treatment, that gene is important to 
## susceptiabilty to the drug.
