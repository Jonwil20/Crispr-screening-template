## By comparing the abundance of CrispR/shRNA in test conditions versus control conditions, we can analyze what genes have a functional role when compared to the test condition. One example of this functional role analysis: If a  set of sgRNA guides targeting are enriched after drug treatment, that gene is important to susceptiabilty to the drug.
